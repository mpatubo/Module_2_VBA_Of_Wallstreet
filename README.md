# Module_2_VBA_Of_Wallstreet

Overview:
The project refactors VBA script that analyzes dataset of stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018.  The goal of refactoring is to make the script run faster and more efficiently.  The code goes through data with for loop.  

Results: 
Although the project calls for 3 output arrays, (to be called tickerVolume, tickerStartingPrices,tickerEndingPrices) I found the 3 cumbersome and do not contribute to efficiency.  Rather, only one going through the for loop (tickerVolume) is sufficient, albeit, simpler.  

Summary: Refactoring is essential in coding.  
Advantages of refactoring: The correct, and/or perfect code cannot possibly be attained on the first try, if at all.  However, refactoring allows one to try different ways to see how various versions of code perform.   
Disadvantages of refactoring:  There is a point where refactoring can have negative returns.  Over analyzing can become counterproductive.
